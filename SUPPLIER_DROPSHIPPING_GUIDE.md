- **Get in writing:**
  - Wholesale pricing (per unit)
  - Setup/monthly fees
  - Turnaround time guarantee
  - Return/refund policy
  - Packaging requirements (unbranded)
  - Encoding process (how to submit URLs)

**Step 2: Integrate with DiscHound Store**

**Option A: Shopify Integration (Tap Tag)**
1. In Vercel, add environment variable:
   ```
   TAPTAG_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
2. Update order confirmation API to forward orders:
   - File: `/app/api/orders/route.ts`
   - Add Tap Tag API call after Stripe success
   - Send customer name, address, product SKU, encoding data

**Option B: Email Automation (All Suppliers)**

   ```
   To: fulfillment@supplier.com
   Subject: DiscHound Order #[ORDER_ID]
   
   New Order for Dropship:
   
   Customer Name: [NAME]
   Shipping Address: [ADDRESS]
   Product: [SKU]

   Ship unbranded. Tracking number to: orders@diskhound.com
   ```

**Option C: CSV Export (Manual Start)**
1. Daily at 9am, export orders from database
2. Upload to supplier portal or send via email
3. Supplier processes batch shipment

**Step 3: Setup Product Encoding**
- Each NFC sticker needs unique URL
- URL format: `https://diskhound.com/track/[ORDER_ID]-[STICKER_NUM]`
- Create tracking page that shows:
  - "This disc belongs to [OWNER]"
  - Contact form to reach owner
  - Lost & Found instructions

### Phase 3: Test Orders (Week 3)

   - ✅ Order received by supplier
   - ✅ Shipped within promised time
   - ✅ Unbranded packaging
   - ✅ NFC encoding works (scan sticker)
   - ✅ Tracking number provided
   - ✅ Stickers arrive intact

**Fix Any Issues Before Launch:**

## 🤖 Order Fulfillment Automation

### Automated Workflow (Recommended)

```

    ↓
Stripe Payment Success
    ↓
Create Order in Database
    ↓
Generate Unique NFC URLs
    ↓
Send Order to Supplier API/Email

    ↓

```

### Implementation

**File:** `/app/api/orders/route.ts`

Add supplier fulfillment function:

```typescript
async function fulfillOrder(order: Order) {
  // Generate encoding URLs
  const encodingURLs = order.orderItems.map((item, index) => {
    return `https://diskhound.com/track/${order.id}-${index + 1}`;
  });
  
  // Format shipping address
  const shippingAddress = `
${order.shippingAddress}
${order.city}, ${order.state} ${order.zipCode}
${order.country || 'USA'}
  `.trim();
  
  // Send to supplier (example: Email)
  await sendEmail({
    to: process.env.SUPPLIER_FULFILLMENT_EMAIL,
    subject: `DiscHound Order #${order.id}`,
    body: `
New Dropship Order

Order ID: ${order.id}
Customer: ${order.customerName}
Email: ${order.email}
Phone: ${order.phone}

Shipping Address:
${shippingAddress}

Products:
${order.orderItems.map((item, i) => `
  - ${item.quantity}x ${item.product.name}
  - Encode with: ${encodingURLs[i]}
`).join('\n')}

Total: $${order.total.toFixed(2)}

Please ship unbranded and provide tracking number.
    `
  });
  
  // Update order status
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: { status: 'PROCESSING' }
  });
}
```

**Add to your order creation:**
```typescript
// After successful payment
const order = await prisma.order.create({...});
await fulfillOrder(order);
```

---

### Tracking Updates

Create webhook endpoint for supplier to send tracking numbers:

**File:** `/app/api/orders/tracking/route.ts`

```typescript
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { orderId, trackingNumber, carrier } = await request.json();
  
  // Verify secret key
  const authKey = request.headers.get('Authorization');
  if (authKey !== process.env.SUPPLIER_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }
  
  // Update order
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: orderId },
    data: {
      status: 'SHIPPED',
      trackingNumber,
      carrier
    }
  });
  
  // Email customer
  await sendShippingEmail(orderId);
  
  return Response.json({ success: true });
}
```

Give this endpoint to your supplier:
```
POST https://diskhound.com/api/orders/tracking
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY

Body:
{
  "orderId": "cm3abc123",
  "trackingNumber": "1Z999AA1234567890",
  "carrier": "UPS"
}
```

## 👥 Customer Service Workflow

### Common Questions & Supplier Coordination

**Q: "When will my order ship?"**
- **Standard Answer:** "Orders ship within 1-2 business days. You'll receive tracking via email."
- **If Delayed:** Contact supplier immediately, offer customer 10% discount code for next order

**Q: "My sticker isn't working"**
- **Troubleshoot:**
  1. Is NFC enabled on phone?
  2. Is sticker close enough? (tap directly to back of phone)
  3. Try different phone
- **If Defective:** Contact supplier for replacement, send customer new sticker immediately (eat the cost for customer satisfaction)

**Q: "Can I get a refund?"**
- **Policy:** 30-day money-back guarantee
- **Process:**
  1. Customer returns product (or not, if cost < $10)
  2. Issue refund via Stripe
  3. Notify supplier to cancel shipment (if not shipped)
  4. Track return rate - if >5%, investigate supplier quality

**Q: "My package is lost"**
- **Process:**
  1. Check tracking number
  2. If lost by carrier → File claim with supplier
  3. Send replacement immediately to customer
  4. Supplier covers cost if insurance included

---

### Returns & Refunds SOP

**Supplier Agreement Must Include:**
- Who pays return shipping? (Ideally supplier for defects)
- Defect replacement timeline (48-72 hours max)
- How to report quality issues
- Insurance on shipments over $50

**Your Policy:**
- 30-day satisfaction guarantee
- Free replacement for defects
- Full refund if not satisfied (customer keeps stickers)
- Track return rate by supplier → Switch if >5%

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Supplier shipping times are slow**
- **Solution:** Switch to Tap Tag or negotiate expedited handling
- **Prevention:** Set clear SLAs in contract

**Issue: NFC encoding is wrong**
- **Solution:** Provide clearer URL template, test before bulk orders
- **Prevention:** Send sample encoding file with each order

**Issue: Packaging has supplier branding**
- **Solution:** Immediately request re-ship, negotiate credit
- **Prevention:** Specify "unbranded packaging" in every order email

**Issue: Customer complaints about quality**
- **Solution:** Order new samples, compare to original
- **If Quality Declined:** Switch suppliers or negotiate price reduction

**Issue: Supplier out of stock**
- **Solution:** Have backup supplier ready (this is why you test 2-3)
- **Prevention:** Ask supplier for stock levels weekly

**Issue: International customs delays**
- **Solution:** Use domestic suppliers (Tap Tag, GoToTags)
- **For International:** Warn customers of longer delivery (7-14 days)
